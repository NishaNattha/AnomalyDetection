# Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic Using Machine Learning

### Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to detect anomalous network traffic using the NSL-KDD dataset. The goal is to enhance cybersecurity by identifying potential intrusions and attacks in network traffic. The results are presented in a dashboard for better visualization and analysis.

### Features
  - Dataset: NSL-KDD (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hassan06/nslkdd)
  - Machine Learning Model: Trained to classify normal and 4 type of anomalous traffic
  - Dashboard: visualization of detection results
  - Use Case: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for cybersecurity

### Technologies Used
  - Python (Machine Learning & Data Processing)
  - Pandas, NumPy (Data Handling)
  - Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (Model Training)
  - Matplotlib, (Data Visualization)
  - Tkinter (Dashboard Development)

### Future Improvements
  - Implement deep learning or other models for improved accuracy
  - Integrate real-time network traffic monitoring
  - Enhance dashboard with advanced filtering and analytics using website
  - Considered up-to-date dataset to improved accuracy and reduce process runtime
